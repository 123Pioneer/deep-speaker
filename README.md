# Deep Speaker from Baidu Research
Deep Speaker: an End-to-End Neural Speaker Embedding System https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.02304.pdf

This project is still `WORK IN PROGRESS`!

So please message me if you want to contribute. I'll be happy to hear your ideas. There are a lot of undisclosed things in the paper, such as:

- Input size to the network?
- How many filter banks do we use?
- Average Pooling 1D or 2D?

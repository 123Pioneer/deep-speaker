# Deep Speaker from Baidu Research
Deep Speaker: an End-to-End Neural Speaker Embedding System https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.02304.pdf

This project is still `WORK IN PROGRESS`!

Work accomplished so far:
- [x] Triplet loss
- [x] Implementation Model
- [ ] Define the inputs to the models
- [ ] Determine the sample rate
- [ ] Train the models
- [ ] We're going to use the LibriSpeech dataset http://www.openslr.org/12/ with 5k+ speakers.

So please message me if you want to contribute. I'll be happy to hear your ideas. There are a lot of undisclosed things in the paper, such as:

- Input size to the network?
- How many filter banks do we use?
- Sample Rate?
